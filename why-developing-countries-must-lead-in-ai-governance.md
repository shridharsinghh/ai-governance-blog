Title: Why Developing Countries Must Lead in AI Governance

Introduction:
As artificial intelligence (AI) transforms industries, governments, and societies, the conversation around how to govern it is becoming more urgent. Yet, much of this conversation is led by a handful of countries in the Global North. This imbalance risks creating global AI norms that ignore the values, challenges, and opportunities unique to developing nations. If AI is to be aligned with the needs of all humanity, then countries like India must not only participate in AI governance—but lead it.

Why It Matters for Developing Countries
The impact of AI in developing countries is profound. From agriculture to healthcare to education, AI-powered systems are already influencing decision-making, resource distribution, and service delivery. However, without thoughtful governance, these technologies could widen inequality, erode privacy, and automate discrimination at scale. Many countries in the Global South face the dual challenge of harnessing AI for growth while managing its risks with limited regulatory infrastructure.

Additionally, developing countries often receive AI systems that are designed elsewhere, trained on non-local data, and optimized for different social contexts. This raises questions of fairness, relevance, and control. If these nations do not help shape global standards, they risk becoming passive recipients of powerful technologies they cannot fully influence or regulate.

What Developing Countries Can Contribute
Despite these challenges, developing nations bring unique strengths to the AI governance conversation. They offer diverse cultural values and ethical frameworks that can enrich global debates about what AI should or should not do. Countries like India, for example, have strong technical talent and successful digital governance models like Aadhaar and UPI, which can serve as blueprints for responsible innovation.

Moreover, public institutions in these countries are often more in touch with the grassroots, making them well-positioned to consider AI's societal impacts in real time. By contributing to open-source models, regional policy coalitions, and inclusive research networks, developing nations can shape governance mechanisms that are context-sensitive, transparent, and globally applicable.

Barriers and How to Overcome Them
There are obstacles to this leadership. Limited institutional capacity, insufficient funding for AI policy research, and lack of representation in international AI forums often restrict participation. But these can be addressed. Governments can invest in AI ethics research, support international collaborations, and actively engage in global AI standard-setting bodies.

In parallel, educational institutions can introduce AI governance as a field of study, training the next generation of technologists and policymakers to think critically about the long-term implications of these systems.

Conclusion
The future of AI governance must be inclusive, global, and just. For that to happen, developing countries cannot remain on the sidelines. They must shape the rules, build the institutions, and lead the conversations. Only then can AI truly serve the entire world—not just a privileged few.
